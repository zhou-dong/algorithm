/**
 * Practice of "cracking the code interview"
 * 
 * An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly “first
 * in, first out” basis. People must adopt either the “oldest” (based on arrival
 * time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would
 * prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They
 * cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data
 * structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue,
 * dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in Linked List
 * data structure.
