/**
 * 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
 * 
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of
 * each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top
 * edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom
 * edges.
 * 
 * Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell
 * to another one with height equal or lower.
 * 
 * Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific
 * and Atlantic ocean.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter.
 * 
 * Both m and n are less than 150.
