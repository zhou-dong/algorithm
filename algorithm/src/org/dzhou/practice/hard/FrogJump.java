/**
 * 403. Frog Jump
 * 
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * 
 * A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each
 * unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it
 * must not jump into the water.
 * 
 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
 * determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last
 * stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump
 * must be 1 unit.
 * 
 * If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1,
 * k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100.
 * 
 * Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
 * 
 * The first stone's position is always 0.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
 * 
 * There are a total of 8 stones.
 * 
 * The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
 * 
 * third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
 * 
 * The last stone at the 17th unit.
 * 
 * Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping
 * 
 * 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then
 * 
 * 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
 * 
 * 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
 * 
 * Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between
 * the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
