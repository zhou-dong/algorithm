 * 
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first
 * bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 * 
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether
 * version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You
 * should minimize the number of calls to the API.
